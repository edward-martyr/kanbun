# The `kanbun` package

The `kanbun` package, like other *kanbun-kundoku* (漢文訓読) LaTeX packages (such as `gckanbun`), allows users to manually input macros for elements in a *kanbun-kundoku* paragraph.

More importantly, it accepts plain text input in the “*kanbun* annotation” form when used with LuaLaTeX, which allows typesetting *kanbun-kundoku* paragraphs efficiently.
